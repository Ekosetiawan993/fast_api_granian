### Learning Python tools that based on Rust.

This repository contains some random python web application code that I copy or write in the process of learning Granian and UV.

>> How to execute via terminal
```bash
granian --interface asgi main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8086
```


Notes:
1. _uv sync_ : like pip install -r requierements.txt but based on .toml file
2. _uv add pytest --dev_
